# Matplotlib Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning and experimentation with **Matplotlib**, a powerful Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It showcases various types of plots, customization techniques, and best practices for effective data visualization.


## Overview

Matplotlib is one of the most widely used libraries for data visualization in Python. This repository includes my progress as I explore plotting techniques, from basic graphs like line and bar plots to more advanced visualizations such as scatter plots and histograms. It also covers various customization options to improve the readability and aesthetics of the plots.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, clone it and install the necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adeelasaleem694/matplotlib-learning.git
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Basic Plots

This section covers basic plot types, such as:
- Line plots
- Bar plots
- Scatter plots
- Histograms

## Advanced Plots

Explore more complex visualizations like:
- Stacked bar charts
- 3D plots
- Pie charts

## Customization

Learn to enhance your plots by adding:
- Titles, axis labels, and legends
- Gridlines
- Custom colors and styles

## Examples

Examples include:
- Combined bar graphs for comparing multiple data sets
- Customizations for improving plot clarity and aesthetics
